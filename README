--- Advent of Haskell --

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) challenges
using Haskell. This is my first experience with Haskell, so it should be an interesting
experience!

--- About Advent of Code ---

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to [Share] it with others, or directly via PayPal or bitcoin.
